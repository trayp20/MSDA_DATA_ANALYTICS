## 📌 Key Projects

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Performed data cleaning, transformation, and visualization
- Used `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` to uncover insights
- Focused on identifying trends, outliers, and correlations

### 2. Predictive Modeling
- Built supervised learning models (e.g., linear regression, random forests)
- Evaluated models with cross-validation, precision, recall, and F1 score
- Tools used: `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, and `statsmodels`

### 3. Time Series Forecasting
- Analyzed and forecasted temporal data using ARIMA and LSTM models
- Applied stationarity tests and seasonal decomposition
- Used: `pmdarima`, `statsmodels`, `tensorflow.keras`

### 4. Capstone Project
- Developed an end-to-end data science project from problem definition to deployment
- Focused on Reinforcement Learning 
- Tools: Python, Jupyter, Git, Tableau, SQL
